<h1> January 2021 Project: Preference Extensions in Social Choice </h1>

<p> This is the website for the January 2021 Master of Logic project on Preference Extensions in Social Choice. I'll post all information related to the project on this page. The project will start with a week of lectures. Each student will then read and present a paper. The main deliverable of the project is a final paper due at the end of the 4th week.

  <h3> Presentations: </h3>

<p>Here is some <a href="https://staff.science.uva.nl/u.endriss/how-to/give-a-talk/">advice on giving a talk</a> by Ulle Endriss. Most things you need to consider before giving any kind of presentation are mentioned, so it's helpful to read even if you might not end up implementing all his suggestions. Note that some of it is written with conference-style talks in mind, so you can ignore those parts, or save them somewhere in the back of your mind for future endeavors. </p>

<p> Here is a simple <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/beamer-presentation/zxrfltwmbcrt#.WxkMjlOFNAY">beamer template</a> for those of you who might want it to make your slides. Feel free to use/create your own or play around with this one to make it more your own style.</p>

<h2>Week 1</h2>
Lectures. 
<br>
<table class="styled" width = "80%" border="0" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="5" bg>
  <tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><th>Monday 10:00-12:00</th><td width="60%">Introduction. We went over the framework, saw some examples of extensions, and a first impossibility result---the Kannai-Peleg Theorem.  <a href="rankingsetsofobjects.pdf">Here</a>'s the paper by Barber&agrave;, Bossert, and Pattanaik* (Note that Thms. 8 and 9 are incorrect). And <a href="kannaipeleg.pdf"> here</a>'s the paper by Kannai and Peleg. (<a href="lecture12020.pdf">slides</a>.)  </td></tr>

  <tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><th>Tuesday 10:00-12:00</th><td width="60%"> We looked at reactions to the Kannai-Peleg Theorem. We saw an impossibility result that does not require the preferences over sets to be connex or transitive. We saw the effect of weakening axioms. We saw two more prominent extensions, and started looking at the voting framework. (<a href="lecture22021.pdf">slides</a>.)</td></tr>

<tr bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><th>Thursday 10:00-12:00</th><td width="60%">We looked at preference extensions and their role in strategyproofness results in voting.In particular we saw various generalisations of the Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem to irresolute rules.  (<a href="lecture32021.pdf">slides</a>.)</td></tr>

  <h3> Papers: </h3>

<p> In the third week you should all choose a paper topic and start working on your idea. During this week I want to set up meetings with each of you to discuss (and approve) your idea and discuss what you'll focus on going forward. 

  <p><b>What I Expect from your Paper:</b> You have two options for the final paper.  You can either come up with an original idea and develop it as far as you can, or you can do a thorough analysis of existing work. The first option is not as daunting as it looks. Since this is a short project, it is ok if you don't manage to prove some amazing result, as long as you explain what your goal was and why you did not manage to come up with a proof (this does not mean something like "it was hard and I didn't have much time"). I expect everything in your papers to be correct, and well written. The deadline for the paper is at the end of the fourth week, but you will need time for the pre-writing work that goes into the paper so get started early.</p>

<p>In principle, any paper topic related to preference extensions is fair game. If anything piqued your interest during the first couple weeks and you already have a vague idea, that's great! Email me and we can make it less vague together. For those of you who aren't sure what to write about, I'll try to come up with a few suggestions for possible topics. </p>

<p>When you get to the writing stage, you can have a look at this <a href="https://staff.science.uva.nl/u.endriss/how-to/write-a-paper/">advice on writing a paper</a>. Your paper should be around 4-5 pages long (including references), using the <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/authors_kit">IJCAI LaTeX style</a>. The (tentative) submission deadline for the paper is <b>Friday 29 January 2020</b>.</p>
